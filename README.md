### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Danny, I'm looking to start a career as a software developer!

Coding for me started out as an exploration of curiosity. This curiosity turned into a hobby and, one day, I  hope to turn this hobby into a career.

I've learned some rudimentary Python and am now branching out into HTML/CSS and JavaScript!

I'm studying with the help of Get Coding.
